<!--Honestly, I did not pay attention to the request to use console and made this work without, then re-read the instructions
and realized that I needed to use console to debug. After brushing up on our course material, I added that to my next iteration.
I don't think we were supposed to use 'focusout', (let) variable = __ , but I promise it was not external source/a.i based,
I simply tried that with recycled code from our last in class activity, and it worked.-->
